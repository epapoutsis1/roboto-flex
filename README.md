# type-single-page
This project exposed me to the different elements of Roboto Flex. This upgraded version of Roboto is used by designers across different screen sizes and resolutions making it more dynamic. I ended up with 13 font variations for my type specimen website and learned how to add animations to the font family. Futhermore, I used JavaScript to integrate the cursor animation on click and hover for a better experience.
